## Title
WEATHER DASHBOARD

## Description
This weather dashboard allows users to search for a city and view its current and future weather conditions. The city is also added to the search history for easy access. The current weather conditions display the city name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representation of weather conditions. The future weather conditions display a 5-day forecast that includes the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representation of weather conditions. Users can click on a city in the search history to view its current and future weather conditions again.
